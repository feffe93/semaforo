# What is this

A very stupid script to loop between the colors of a traffic light using Arduino Uno.

I actually got an used traffic light when they replaced the ones at the nearest crossroads.

I connected all the lamps to a relay connected to my Arduino Uno board and wrote this script to emulate the typical GREEN/YELLOW/RED loop of a traffic light

Enjoy!
